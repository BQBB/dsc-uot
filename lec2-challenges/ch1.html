                Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime
                environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code
                outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write
                command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts
                server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is
                sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a
                "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application
                development around a single programming language, rather than
                different languages for server-side and client-side scripts. Though
                .js is the standard filename extension for JavaScript code, the name
                "Node.js" doesn't refer to a particular file in this context and is
                merely the name of the product. Node.js has an event-driven
                architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to
                optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many
                input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications
                (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).[7] The
                Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the
                Node.js Foundation,[8] and has now merged with the JS Foundation to
                form the OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by the Linux
                Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[9]
